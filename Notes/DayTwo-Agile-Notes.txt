Software Development Life Cycle:

	1. Gathering Requirements
	2. Analysis 
	3. Designing
	4. Coding
	5. Testing
	6. Maintenance

Agile Process: Agile is a software development process model where development and testing activities go parallelly and collaboratively.

Agile Team: Developers + Testers + Product Owners + Scrum Master

In Agile, Most of the time, documentation is avoided. Instead of it, we need Epic, Feature and Story.

Epic: Large and High Level Requirement

Feature: We have to derived Epic into smaller pieces i.e. called features.

Story: The smallest requirement that needs to be achieved by testers and developers.

Business Analyst: In waterfall or any other model, BA plays an important role to understand and gather the business requirement from client/stakeholders.

Product Owner: In Agile, we don't have business analyst. PO is responsible for getting the requirement from customer/client/stakeholders.
